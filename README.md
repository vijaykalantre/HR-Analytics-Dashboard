# HR Analytics Dashboard

This project provides deep insights into workforce dynamics using a powerful and interactive HR analytics dashboard. The analysis includes employee demographics, department-wise income, attrition, job roles, and satisfaction levels.

Organizations often struggle to identify the root causes behind employee attrition and performance issues. HR data remains underutilized due to a lack of visualization and actionable insights.
